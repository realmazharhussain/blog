        <description>Following is an explained step by step process to rename multiple files (mostly) any way you want using bash with examples
Note: Anything after a hash/pound symbol (#) in a line in the examples is a comment and can be ignored without any effect on the process. It is there just to explain things.
Why not use Graphical tools for this? Graphical tools are great. Use them if they do what you want.</description>

        <description>In this tutorial, we will learn how to colorize Linux Terminal in order to make it exciting and fun. In addition, we will also set-up command auto-suggestion, command completion, syntax-highlighting, and other useful stuff. Although this tutorial is primarily for Linux users, users of Termux, Windows Subsystem for Linux, Cygwin, MacOS, or other Unix-like Operating Systems can also follow this guide but some steps may be a little different for those users.</description>

        <description>What is Git? Git is a version control system. It means it can save multiple versions of files in a project. The project is simply just a folder to be used with git. That folder can contain anything e.g. source code of a program, images, Photoshop project file, videos, etc.
It is a program that saves everything locally on your computer i.e. it works offline
What is a Git Repository? A folder whose files and sub-folders are being saved/managed by Git is called a git repository or a git repo.</description>
