title: 'Why use Linux?'
---

There are many reasons as to why you should at least try linux for once.

## Linux is free

Yes, unlike Windows or Mac OS, you do not have to pay in order to get Linux. Most of the apps built for Linux are also free.

## You are in-charge of your Computer

If you use Windows, you know what I mean. Windows downloads and installs updates without asking the user. It automatically installs stuff from Microsoft Store.
If you use Linux, nothing happens unless you want it to happen. There are no automatic updates unless want automatic updates.

## Less chance of virus attacks

Viruses often come from pirated/cracked software which is most of the software you use on Windows. You may use an antivirus software but newer viruses are not recognized by antivirus software and your Windows installation gets infected.
In case of Linux, Most of the software is free and open source and provided by Creators of the distro you are using. So, there is no chance of virus attacks on this side of things.
In addition, most of the people use Windows and Mac OS. Hence hackers build viruses for those OSes instead of making viruses for Linux.
As a result, Linux is much more secure than Windows or Mac OS.

## Customization

In Windows or Mac OS, you get the same looking desktop which you can customize to a very limited extent.
Whereas, in Linux, you can customize every single bit of your installation.
Don’t like the desktop? change it. Don’t like the login screen? change it. Don’t like the boot screen? change it. Don’t like the boot menu screen? change it. Don’t like the File Manager? change it.
Basically, you can change anything.
There are thousands of themes available for linux.

## Privacy

Since the source code is available for everyone online, anything wrong or against user privacy can be noted by anyone who reads the source code. So, developers cannot disrespect user privacy. If you are wondering who would read so long source code, the answer is, a lot of people do. If a programmer uses a linux program and finds that it can be improved, they have to read and understand the code in order to improve it.
The whole idea of linux is centered around privacy and freedom of use.

## Bring life to old and slower hardware

There are some distros that are specifically build for old or slow computers. Even general distros are also light on resources. A full fledged distro like debian takes about only 10GB of disk space and can run on 2GB of RAM. Lightweight distros can run on less than 512MB of ram and may take less than 2GB of disk space.
